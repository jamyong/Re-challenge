## Introduction
Pruning is an important way to optimize neural networks. In recent years, there have been many different implementations. However, this ICLR paper, which examined the performance of seven different types of pruning methods, doubts the actual effect of pruning. We reproduced the experimental results of this conference paper and Ô¨Ånally proved that the experimental results are basically consistent.
